          Meditation. Tetris but everything is a square made of blocks. things slide and on a connection of three blocks
          of thesame colour they disappear into the ether.
        </p>
        <p>
          Squares fall, while I attempt extrapolating where the blocks will end up. The red one slides down a slope of
          blue and yellow blocks with anticipation I watch it as it stops upon hitting two of its slanted brethren.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tactile click plays in my headphones as the blocks turn into particles. Ricocheting the blue block above it
          slides towards the centre. Click. White blocks sliding from the right. Click. A flurry of particles, music
          changes.
