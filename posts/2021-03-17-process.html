                <p>While growing up there have been multiple times when I tried making games, but in reality I wanted to
                    play games, not make them. On the notion that playing games is fun I thought that making the
                    imaginary games is my head would be cool. The cool part was the end – the <strong>made</strong>
                    product. It was not the process of <strong>making</strong> it.</p>

                <p>Going to a game jam in 2018 and that was the first time I made a game and enjoyed the process of it.
                    I didn’t do any coding, but I worked with other people, talked about the process that they were
                    taking, I made some kinda shitty art and some kinda crap level design, I saw people play the game
                    and got feedback on it. Likewise, I played other games and gave feedback. It was an absolute blast
                    and I feel in love with the process. The act of <strong>making</strong> was the fun part.</p>
                <p>There are people that say they want to make games, but they want <strong>made games</strong> – not to
                    make them. It is easy to make an assumption that you want to make something when you dream of an
                    artefact that does not (yet) exist. You want it to exist and the way for it to exist is by it being
                    made. <strong>If you make it then you can make it exactly the way you want to make it.</strong> And
                    that’s why I believe people can easily think that they want to make a game. Because they have an
                    idea, they want that idea to become a reality.</p>
                <p>I think this is quite a normal assumption to make, but it is definitely more common than I have
                    expected. I’m attending the Games course at ITU in Copenhagen, a master’s degree about video games.
                    I expected people here to be super enthusiastic about making games. Some are, but definitely not
                    all. In their defence, this course is not just about making games but also games as a medium to
                    study – imagine a literature course that’s both about analysing writings and writing them but for
                    games.</p>
                <p>But I digress, I recently watched an old <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv4YqFp5axc" target="_blank">interview with Derek Yu</a>
                    of Spelunky and a line struck me there where Derek said that he was always proactive about searching
                    for communities that his creative interests. The solution to being surrounded with people that want
                    made is to <strong>find a community of people that want to make games.</strong></p>

                                people there. Over the past year I tried to find digital places that would replace these

                <p>Here are some cool communities I found of people making games:<br />
                    <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discord.gg/26MMzk9dcB" target="_blank">NYU Game Center
                        Events DIscord</a> – NYU’s games programme hosts playtesting sessions every Thursday where you
                    can show up with your game or play some cool games<br />

                    podcast is amazing and so is the community of people in their discord. While it’s not <em>only</em>
                    about making games which I think is important as there are more places to find inspiration in<br />
                    <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discord.gg/zSxH7hScSV" data-type="URL"

                    really cool gamedev and there are a few people in his discord that share their progress and that
                    always inspires me. Tiny place, sometimes it’s quiet but very wholesome people.<br />

                    really games related, it’s an animation and motion graphics that’s small enough to have a good sense
                    of community and big enough to find fun people to chat with. Animation is a big part of games (topic
                    for another post) so consider checking it out.<br />
